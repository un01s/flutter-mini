# Flutter Mini

The main idea is to try github action for different releases.

## code is from [Flutter_barebones](https://github.com/Toglefritz/flutter_barebones)

The real meat is main.dart, which could be found under the subdirectory lib.

## github actions

the script for github action can be found under ```.github/workflows/release.yml```.
